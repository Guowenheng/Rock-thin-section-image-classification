# Rock-thin-section-image-classification
Microscopic rock thin section image recognition is crucial in rock mineral analysis. Typically, deep learning models are used to automate expert knowledge, but the scarcity of samples in certain categories limits the available training data, affecting the performance of traditional deep learning models. This paper proposes a novel few-shot learning model to address the challenge of classifying rock thin section images under limited sample conditions. Based on advanced few-shot learning processes involving pre-training and meta-training, we first introduce a Cross Attention Feature Fusion (CAFF) module. This module generates new features by plane polarized light images (PPL) and cross-polarized light images (XPL) of rock thin sections under a microscope, integrating these with the original features through autonomous learning to obtain more comprehensive features. Secondly, we propose a Feature Selection (FS) module based on the prototypical network (ProtoNet). This module extracts key feature dimensions by focusing on representative features within the same class and distinguishing features between classes, helping the model concentrate on crucial dimensions to mitigate the impact of feature sparsity. Finally, evaluated on the Nanjing University rock teaching sample dataset using ResNet50 and Swin-Transformer pre-trained on ImageNet-1000k, the ProtoNet+CAFF+FS model achieved average classification accuracies of 96.70\% and 99.16\% in the 5-Way 5-Shot few-shot task, respectively, surpassing traditional methods and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules
